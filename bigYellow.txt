This is a big yellow one
The most yellow one?
Sure! and is there a space named ‘space’ or ‘index’ in .git?
The excellent feature of git is that git tracks & managers changes, rather than files
Fix again to test if the changes within Index will be commited
There is also a big black one!
The are big yellow one AND big black one
